1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Complementing the previous video and taking advantage of the fact that we are in

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,500
other time than the arms race, there is something very interesting

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,080
that I want to show you here.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:20,199
When it comes to the drone tax segment, people think they are stuck

5
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:23,719
resources with a drone, but it is not interesting to spend resources on a drone.

6
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:28,280
There's another secret here. The secret to this tab is the use of vigor.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:35,039
So, as you can see, I need to reach 30 thousand points here.

8
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,719
And to reach 30 thousand points, the easiest way is using vigor,

9
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,960
spending 300 stamina, but then you're left thinking,

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,000
LuÃ­s, how am I going to spend 300 stamina, where am I going to get 300 stamina.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,879
So I say calm down, first thing, guys.

12
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:52,920
You come here to the alliance store.

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,520
In the VIP store, you can buy vigor.

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,719
It has a limit, but you can buy it.

15
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:04,240
And you also have to keep track of time to be able to restart.

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,280
You already do it again, maybe on a specific day you have to win

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,359
corridorably. So, you plan for that.

18
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,359
Another place where you can buy stamina.

19
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:20,000
Here, without stamina, then you say, wow, 300 diamonds to buy stamina.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,959
But you have to understand that we buy 300,

21
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,560
without stamina with 300 diamonds, but we also gain 50 stamina.

22
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,879
Gain 100 stamina twice per day.

23
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,960
50 stamina twice a day.

24
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,359
That alone is 200, but what can you get from equilinology.

25
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,719
So, what's interesting that people don't notice?

26
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,519
It's just that, on the face of it, we already win, if we add it all up,

27
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:57,400
here you get 50, but 150, 350 diamonds.

28
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:03,280
Only from here are the fragments and universal recruitment tickets.

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,319
The hero universal fragments and the tickets.

30
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,879
Calm down, who still has more?

31
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,360
If you spend 300, you have to spend 300 what?

32
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,240
On the battlefield, correct?

33
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,640
So, we come here to the world.

34
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,520
In the world, we still have another situation,

35
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:31,400
which is what we have an area task of defeating 5 zombies.

36
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,560
You defeat 5 zombies without giving a medal.

37
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:41,640
In addition to having these other missions, which give a little diamond each one.

38
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:45,719
If we are going to make the zombies, in addition to buying the area task,

39
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:52,679
We can make a zombie attack of a light or maximum level that we haven't reached yet.

40
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:54,799
But it's already 70.

41
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,799
So, you get a lot of diamonds here.

42
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:03,199
You attack 4 normal zombies, then you go and move to the side to attack the last level.

43
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,199
Still, guys, we still have the D1 Elite.

44
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:09,479
Except you spent 50 stamina.

45
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:12,519
What's missing are 13 attacks in D1 Elite.

46
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,519
But you can note that the D1 Elite can also give you diamonds.

47
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,039
Besides, I've already killed a few Elites here.

48
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,000
I didn't get a diamond, but look.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,919
I won tickets and recruitments, and I won accelerators that are very important for you to move to the next level faster.

50
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:37,039
Because waiting for construction in itself ends up getting in our way

51
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,400
is still developing.

52
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:55,799
Another thing I want to take advantage of is that since I have the unit progression event,

53
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:02,319
two o'clock in the morning, and here it's 15 and 35,

54
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,759
How do I program myself?

55
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:12,719
There are practically 10 hours left before collection.

56
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,560
So what do I do?

57
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,560
I asked my soldiers to attack me in 1 or 2 hours.

58
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,879
Because after they're all gone, I'll go and put 8 hours left.

59
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:28,879
So I can collect it exactly on time,

60
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:35,040
in which there will be an arms broker event regarding unit progression.

61
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
Right?

62
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,560
So, don't be afraid to spend, force and buy the things you love.

63
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,279
Using diamond is important for you to achieve your goals.

64
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,879
And at this moment of the day, it's a great time for you to score well.

65
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:57,480
You got 30 thousand points in the arms brokerage and still win a lot of other things at that moment.

66
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,280
In addition to being good for you to evolve slightly,

67
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,319
You still get many other things that will make your team much stronger.

68
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:09,080
Your heroes become stronger.

69
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,560
So, open your eyes and take this tip.
