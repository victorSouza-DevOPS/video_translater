1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Complementing the previous video and taking advantage of the fact that we are in the

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,500
another time other than the arms race, there is something very interesting

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,080
that I want to show you here.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:20,199
When it comes to the drone tax segment, people think of choking

5
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:23,719
resources with drone, but it is not interesting to spend resources with drone.

6
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:28,280
There's another secret here. The secret of this tab is the use of vigor.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:35,039
So, as you can see, I need to get up to 30,000 points here.

8
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,719
And to get to 30,000 points, the easiest way using vigor,

9
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,960
spending 300 of vigor, but then you're thinking,

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,000
LuÃ­s, how am I going to spend 300 of vigor, where I'm going to get 300 of vigor.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,879
Then I say calm, first thing, people.

12
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:52,920
It's you coming here to the covenant store.

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,520
In the VIP store, you can buy vigor.

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,719
It has a limit, but you can buy it.

15
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:04,240
And you also have to keep track of time to be able to restart.

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,280
You already do it again, it will be a certain specific day that you make

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,359
hallway. So, you program yourself for that.

18
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,359
Another place you can buy vigor.

19
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:20,000
Here, without vigor, then you say, wow, 300 diamonds to buy vigor.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,959
But you have to understand that we buy 300,

21
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,560
without vigor with 300 diamonds, but we also gain 50 vigor.

22
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,879
Gains 100 stamina twice a day.

23
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,960
50 of vigor twice a day.

24
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,359
Only then it's 200, but what you get from equilinology.

25
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,719
Then, what is interesting that people don't notice?

26
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,519
It's just that, in our faces, we already win, if we add everything up,

27
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:57,400
here you get 50, but 150, 350 diamonds.

28
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:03,280
Only from here, are the fragments and universal recruitment tickets.

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,319
The hero universal fragments and the tickets.

30
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,879
Calm down, who else has it?

31
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,360
If you spend 300, you have to spend 300 what?

32
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,240
On the battlefield, correct?

33
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,640
So, we come here to the world.

34
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,520
In the world, we still have another situation,

35
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:31,400
which is what we have an area task that is to defeat 5 zombies.

36
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,560
You defeat 5 zombies without giving a medal.

37
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:41,640
In addition to having these other missions, which each give a little diamond.

38
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:45,719
If we're going to do the zombies, in addition to buying the area task,

39
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:52,679
we can make a zombie attack of a slight or maximum that we haven't reached yet.

40
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:54,799
But it's already 70.

41
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,799
So, you get a lot of diamond here.

42
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:03,199
You attack 4 normal zombies, then you go and pass to the side to attack the last level.

43
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,199
Also, guys, we still have D1 Elite.

44
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:09,479
But you spent 50 stamina.

45
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:12,519
What's missing is 13 attacks in D1 Elite.

46
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,519
But you can see that D1 Elite can also give you diamonds.

47
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,039
Besides, I've already killed some of an Elite here.

48
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,000
I didn't get a diamond, but look at that.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,919
I won tickets and recruits, and I won accelerators that are very important for you to pass the level faster.

50
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:37,039
Because waiting for the construction by itself ends up hindering us

51
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,400
is still developing.

52
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:55,799
Another thing I want to take advantage of is that since I have the unit progression event,

53
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:02,319
at two o'clock in the morning, and here it's 15 and 35,

54
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,759
how do I program myself?

55
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:12,719
There are practically 10 hours left to be able to collect.

56
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,560
So what do I do?

57
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,560
I put my soldiers for me to attack in 1 or 2 hours.

58
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,879
Because then, all of them are over, I go and put in 8 hours left.

59
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:28,879
That then I can collect exactly on time,

60
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:35,040
in which the corretarmamentista's event regarding unit progression will take place.

61
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
Right?

62
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,560
So, do not be afraid to spend, vigor and buy things where lover.

63
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,279
Wearing diamonds is important for you to achieve your goals.

64
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,879
And at this time of day, it's a great time for you to score well.

65
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:57,480
You got 30,000 points in the corretarmamentista and still win a lot of other things at that time.

66
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,280
In addition to being good for you to evolve lightly,

67
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,319
you still get many other things that will make the SU team much stronger.

68
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:09,080
Your heroes get stronger.

69
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,560
So, open your eye and take this tip.
